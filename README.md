# EquationHub
#### Version dev18.1.1.2
EquationHub is a program that is currently in development that plans on containing most equations for solving. This program will eventually support graphs, but that will be in a much later version.

These are the following equations that are in the program

# Power

P = V * I

P = Power
V = Voltage
I = Current
